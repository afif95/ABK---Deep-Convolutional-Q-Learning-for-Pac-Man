# Deep-Convolutional-Q-Learning-for-Pac-Man

## Description:

This project implements a Deep Convolutional Q-Learning (DQL) agent to learn and play Pac-Man, achieving scores exceeding 500 in environments without full action space access. Leveraging PyTorch and the gym library, the agent trains on the MsPacmanDeterministic-v0 environment.

**Environment:** https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/atari/pacman/

## Key Features:

- Employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for efficient image processing.
- Utilizes the Double DQN approach for improved stability and performance.
- Implements experience replay and epsilon-greedy exploration for robust learning.
- Achieves superior results compared to previous approaches, demonstrating successful training in limited action space environments.

Note: GPU acceleration is recommended for faster training. V100 GPU was used for training.
